## What

Images for use on [Notifiarr](https://notifiarr.wiki) and [Dockwatch](https://github.com/Notifiarr/dockwatch).

# Why

The initial images were copied from <https://github.com/walkxcode/dashboard-icons> because that repo updates slowly. We intend to update this repo rapidly.

## Contributing Icons

- Icons should be PNG format and at least 128x128, max of 512x768.
- Avoid icons that are significantly wider than their height.
- Shrink the bytes at [CompressPNG.com](https://compresspng.com) or [TinyPNG.com](https://tinypng.com).
- Submit pull requests and engage with us in [Discord](https://notifiarr.com/discord).

## Usage

All images are auto-published to GitHub pages, and can be used in `<img src="">` with this URL format:

```
https://gh.notifiarr.com/images/<repo-path>
ie:
https://gh.notifiarr.com/images/icons/apple.png
https://gh.notifiarr.com/images/icons/github.png
```

The two example URLs have repo paths of `icons/apple.png` and `icons/github.png` respectively.
